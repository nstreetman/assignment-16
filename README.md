#HTML + CSS + JS - Build a Pomodoro Timer

##Description The Pomodoro technique is a well-known tool for productivity where an individual works in a 25 minute interval to accomplish a task. The idea is that when you set the timer and the clock starts ticking, you do nothing but the intended activity for those 25 minutes. Once the 25 minutes is up, one usually takes a 5 minute break to rest, and then afterwards, start another 25 minute Pomodoro interval.

##Objectives

###Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to create event listeners that will listen for a click event that reads from the DOM and modifies the HTML on the page.

You will also be able to utilize setInterval to run a code block that updates the DOM at a repeated interval.

###Performance Objectives

You should:

have decent styling
have a timer that counts down from 25:00 to zero and then flashes a message that the Pomodoro is complete
make the input + button elements go away after the user enters in the Pomodoro task (Normal + Explorer Modes)
make the html reflect a MM:SS timer when counting down.
When the timer gets to < :10 for each minute, it should show two digits:
09, 08, 07 ...
not 9, 8, 7 ...
